# Regression-Algorithms-Implementation
# Overview
This project implements various regression algorithms to provide a comprehensive understanding of regression techniques.

The following algorithms are covered:

- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression


Each algorithm is implemented in separate Jupyter notebooks, and corresponding datasets are provided for experimentation and learning.
